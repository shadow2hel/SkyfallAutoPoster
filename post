Welcome to Skyfall: your future home for a novel and soothing Vanilla experience.
We aim for a hermit like configuration, which is why we have no protection plugins. This community is based around trust. Not to worry, there are failsafes in place in case a bad apple tries to ruin the bunch.

Using custom resources generously made by PsychoProphet we introduce a physical currency that is fully integrated into our economy.

Said currency will be stored in your vault, or deposited in your inventory directly.

This in turn can be used to buy certain items from either playershops or the servershop, or used in black markets ;).

#Features:
* Friendly Community
* Balanced Economy
* Playershops: Make one by left clicking a chest with the item you wish to buy/sell.
* Servershop: The most basic of servershops to ground the economy
* CoreProtect to log all interactions to protect against griefers
* Swift application process, once you're accepted you'll be automatically whitelisted.


#Rules:
* No griefing
* No hacked clients
* No duping/exploit abuse
